## LAMMPS

LAMMPS on OSCER does not come with many packages. To build more packages into LAMMPS, please visit [this page](https://docs.lammps.org/Build_package.html).

To finish this project, build our own LAMMPS version with the following two packages included:

- MANYBODY package. This is to use the manybody potential such as the embedded-atom method potential.
- VORONOI package. This is to calculate Voronoi tessellation of the atoms in the simulation cell. To learn more, please visit [this page](https://docs.lammps.org/compute_voronoi_atom.html).

To achieve that goal, run the `lmp_mbvo.sh` script following [a previous project](https://github.com/shuozhixu/Materials_2024).

63 LAMMPS simulations will be conducted in this project. Each time we run a new simulation, create a new directory.

The interatomic potential is the same one used in our previous project.

## Related to a previous project

In [a previous project of ours](https://github.com/shuozhixu/Materials_2024), the CLS processes in nanolaminated Ag and two types of Ag/Cu nanolaminates were studied. The layer thickness for each metal was 5 nm. No cavities were involved. According to four experimental Ag/Cu nanolminates papers above, (i) there is a cavity-free zone within 20 nm from the interface in the Cu layer and (ii) the cavity can be a void or a He bubble. For cavities near the interface, they adhere to the interface in the Ag layer rather than straddling the interface in both metals. Therefore, if one were to insert a cavity in our previous 5-nm-thick model, the cavity either adheres to the interface in the Ag layer or sits in the middle of the Ag layer. In addition, the cavity's diameter varies from 1 nm to 12 nm according to [Wang et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2018.09.003) While no dislocation climb was observed in our previous project, it might occur because of the void, see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2012.03.050).

Unfortunately, there is no interatomic potentials for Ag/He, and so we only consider void.

## Nanolaminated Ag

Our previous project considered CLS in all three different slip planes. Here, let's consider all of them.

Therefore, we need to insert a void either at the interface or in the middle of a Ag layer where CLS takes place. For each slip plane, let the dislocation glide through the center of the void. The insertion of the void can be done in [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/delete_atoms.html) or [atomsk](https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr/tutorial_removeatoms.php). Three void diameters can be considered: 1 nm, 2 nm, and 3 nm.

Since there are three void sizes, two void locations, and three slip planes, 18 LAMMPS simulations need to be conducted.

## Ag/Cu Nanolaminate - type 1

Our previous project considered CLS in 10 different slip planes, which possess different critical stresses for CLS. Here, let's consider three planes: one with the maximum critical stress, one with the minimum critical stress, and another with the average critical stress.

As a result, 18 LAMMPS simulations need to be conducted.

## Ag/Cu Nanolaminate - type 2

Along the same line of thought, let's consider three planes here too. Similarly, another 18 LAMMPS simulations should be conducted.

## Single crystalline pure metals

There are two pure metals, Cu and Ag. To provide references, we can simulate the dislocation/void interactions in Ag, and compare results with those in nanolaminates. The dislocation line should be 5 nm, the same as those used in nanolaminates. There are two types of boundary conditions along the dislocation line direction: periodic boundary conditions and traction-free boundary conditions. For the first boundary condition, the two void positions are equivalent, and so only the three void diameters should be considered. For the second boundary condition, the two void positions are not equivalent. Thus, 9 LAMMPS simulations should be conducted in single crystalline Ag.

The dislocation/void interactions in a Cu single crystal where the periodic boundary conditions were applied along the dislocation line were modeled in [a previous paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-651X/ab8358), which should be studied closely.
